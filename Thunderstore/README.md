# Description

## Changes main menu logo and mistlands logo. Change change the name it searches for in BepInEx folder. Comes with a default logo & default game logos as examples.

`ONLY WORKS ON Mistlands & later.`

#### Need to Know

- Default names are `LogoChanger_LOGO.png` (1000x394) & `LogoChanger_MistlandsLogo.png` (2048x448)
    - Put the logos anywhere in the BepInEx config folder (though a default folder is created called
      Azumatt.LogoChanger_Images, it's recommended to keep them here.)
    - `Note, the default folder contains the default images inside of a zip called "DefaultLogos.zip". You MUST extract them from there before launching the mod for the first time, as the files must be present to work properly.`
        - If you do not perform this extraction, the mod will seemingly not work. This is because the mod will not be
          able to find the default images to use. Provide your own or extract the default images.
            - Why do it this way?
                - I needed to not include the default images just in case someone has made their own with the same
                  names. If I delete them and replace them with the default images, it would overwrite their images.
                  This way, I can still provide default images without overriding potential custom ones.
- Additionally comes with the default logos as examples to use to make your own.
