> ### v1.0.3
> - Fix a compatibility issue. Thanks to ZenDragon for a report.
> - Moved the default images to the config folder instead of the plugin folder. This will be done automatically. They
    will be moved to the config folder inside of Azumatt.LogoChanger_Images if they meet the requirements. The
    requirements are that the image is prefixed with LogoChanger and is png format.

> - Include the original files in the zip. Forgot them in 1.0.1
> ### v1.0.1
> - Fixed a bug where the logo would not change correctly
> ### v1.0.0
